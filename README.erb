NAME

  openobject

SYNOPSIS

  a simple property based container that's much more capable than a blankslate
  but far less polluted than ruby's built-in OpenStruct.  openobject is a tiny
  lib that couples the power of the 'fattr' gem alongside a slightly
  enhanced blankslate type object.

  gem install openobject
